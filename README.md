# BoardgameListingWebApp

## Description 

**Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application.**
This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, they are required to log in to add/ edit the board games and their reviews. The 'users' have the authority to add board games to the list and add reviews, and the 'managers' have the authority to edit/ delete the reviews on top of the authorities of users.  

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Amazon Web Services(AWS) EC2
- Thymeleaf
- Thymeleaf Fragments
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Spring MVC
- JDBC
- H2 Database Engine (In-memory)
- JUnit test framework
- Spring Security
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Maven

## Features

- Full-Stack Application
- UI components created with Thymeleaf and styled with Twitter Bootstrap
- Authentication and authorization using Spring Security
  - Authentication by allowing the users to authenticate with a username and password
  - Authorization by granting different permissions based on the roles (non-members, users, and managers)
- Different roles (non-members, users, and managers) with varying levels of permissions
  - Non-members only can see the boardgame lists and reviews
  - Users can add board games and write reviews
  - Managers can edit and delete the reviews
- Deployed the application on AWS EC2
- JUnit test framework for unit testing
- Spring MVC best practices to segregate views, controllers, and database packages
- JDBC for database connectivity and interaction
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data in the database
- Schema.sql file to customize the schema and input initial data
- Thymeleaf Fragments to reduce redundancy of repeating HTML elements (head, footer, navigation)

## Create Vm for runner and configure with gitlab runner
1. Create Ec2 instance  and open terminal >> sudo apt upadte
2. on gitlab ci  goto CICD and open new project runner and tag the runner ,register runner and follow instruction to configure VM(ec2) and gitlab runner.After sussecfull configuration vm as runner start writing pipeline > build >> pipeline editor
3.  Install sonarqube on vm, then configure gitlab with sonarqube server @ ip:9000.you can see your project is visible on sonarqube server.
   docker run -d -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community
4. Install Kubernetes component on Master and worker node.Run below command on both master and worker nodes
   1> sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg
   # If the directory `/etc/apt/keyrings` does not exist, it should be created before the curl command, read the note below.
sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.35/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.35/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
2> on Master node
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
(**run kubeadmjoin command on slave/worker node)
3> on master node
  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.27.0/manifests/calico.yaml
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
